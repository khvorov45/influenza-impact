# Tokars Supplementary 

Method 3 step 11
Should be C(m-1) * r(m), see Figure 1.

Method 4 is borderline impossible as specified

Method 6 Step 4
Should be vc_cum * ve, not ve twice

# Applications

Rolfres uses Tokars

Sah has a different model (age and subtype-specific).

# Estimating cases

Rolfes used ready-made CDC data https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/estimates.htm

Their methods are in Reed as per https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/how-cdc-estimates.htm

Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network -> rate of hospitalisation

The method of extrapolating from influenza hospitalisations is in Shrestha

1. Account for test probability/specificity/sensitivity -> estimate of true hospitalised cases for the site

2. Divide by site population -> estimate of rate of influenza hospitalisation

3. Match geographic region to site by level of activity

(4.) Multiply by geographic region's population -> estimate of true hospitalised cases for the region
